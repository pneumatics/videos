This project was intended to disable Pi-hole ad-blocking temporarily as the aggressive ad-blocking some times makes browsing unpleasant . Further it was also inspired by the build by Nick Donaldson - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Unz3OAnC6E
Codes and further details will be shared soon on my github account https://github.com/pneumatics
